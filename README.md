### Hi there 👋


I work as an ML researcher, currently interested in Bayesian modelling, (pre-trained) language models, (learning about) causal inference, and using ideas from information theory on the above. 

I'm also slowly working through the basics of category theory. I'd love to understand how ideas from cat. theory map to applied questions, e.g., the work of Fong, Spivak, et al., with Bayesian networks and data manipulations.
