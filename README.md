### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My favourite equation is: 

$$
e^{A+B} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (e^{A/n}e^{B/n})^n,
$$ 

for any real square matrices $A,\ B$.

I work as an ML researcher, currently interested in Bayesian modelling, (pre-trained) language models, (learning about) causal inference, and using ideas from information theory on the above.
