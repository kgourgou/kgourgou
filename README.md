### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My favourite result this year is the Plancherel theorem

$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\widehat{f}(\xi)|^2  \, d\xi.
$$ 



I work as an ML researcher, currently interested in Bayesian modelling, (pre-trained) language models, (learning about) causal inference, and using ideas from information theory on the above.
