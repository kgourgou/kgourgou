### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My favourite equation is: 

$$
e^{A+B} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (e^{A/n}e^{B/n})^n,
$$ 

for any real square matrices $A,\ B$.

I work as an ML researcher, currently interested in Bayesian methods, (pre-trained) language models, and (learning about) causal inference. 

Some examples of things I've worked on ðŸš€ 

- inference for large Bayesian networks with neural nets,
- coupled RL methods to environments simulated by neural ODEs,
- used information theory to study how parallized simulators behave at long times,
- and connected different aspects of model error with each other.
